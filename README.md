## Knapsnak Problem
It is a famous problem in algorithms which I remember it from university studing.
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

### Method 1: Recursion by Brute-Force algorithm OR Exhaustive Search.
A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets.

### Method 2: Dynamic Programming(DP) problems


## Test Driven Development
