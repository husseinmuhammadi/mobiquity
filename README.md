## Knapsnak Problem
It is a famous problem in algorithms which I remember it from university studing.
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

### Method 1: Recursion by Brute-Force algorithm OR Exhaustive Search.
A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets.

### Method 2: Dynamic Programming(DP) problems


## Test Driven Development

### Create data models and APIs
As we are supposed to put the items in the package with the max value, we create some data models regarding to this challenge
Two data model were created: Knapsnak and KnapsnakItem with some considertation 

### User stoires:
- Knapsnak can not carry more than 100
- The number of items in each problem can not be more than 15 
- Maximum weight of each item can not be more than 100
- Maximum cost of each item can not be more than 100
